Scrum is an iterative, incremental framework for project management often seen in agile software development, a type of software engineering.

Although the Scrum approach was originally suggested for managing product development projects, its use has focused on the management of software development projects, and it can be used to run software maintenance teams or as a general project/program management approach.
