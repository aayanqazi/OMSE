# The SPM and the SDM have decided to augment the initial team organization by hiring two consultants
# – a healthcare domain specialist and a technology specialist who has good experience with personal
# storage devices and handheld mobile devices (PDAs and smart cell phones). These specialists are to
# work with the team to produce a new and accurate project schedule and staffing profile. After this
# they will begin to pro-actively guide project efforts to implement the software that will support
# these domain and technology requirements.

# The SPM, with the assistance of project leads and consultants/specialists, was able to develop a
# representative WBS for the project. Admittedly, it was expressed at a fairly high level, but it was
# a good start. After reviewing this with the entire team, everyone agreed that it was good enough to
# guide requirements and software development activities; and detailed enough to define work packages
# to be allocated to team members. The WBS was composed partly of: level-of-effort activities like SPM
# and project support roles (e.g. SCM, SQA); partly of distinct requirements / application domain
# tasks; and partly of component-centric tasks, that is, tasks focused on building, integrating and
# testing user interfaces, foundation software components, application modules, and COTS software
# products.

# Discussion 5: Developing a Suitable Work Breakdown Structure, April

# Work breakdown structures are driven by the breakdown of software process, requirements,
# modules/components composing the design, and the organization structure for the project.

# a. Given what you now know after completing the various assigned readings, suggest and justify
# activities and tasks that you think should appear at the first and second levels of the WBS.

# b. Use the indented list style and ensure that each task is descriptive enough for others to
# understand the general nature of the task.

# c. Check that project team roles can be mapped to cover at least one branch of the WBS. If any WBS
# elements can’t be covered properly, suggest changes in the organization that you feel are warranted.


* Work Breakdown Structure
  Following Fairley's template, I'd start with something like this, though the absence of an actual
  ADV will make this harder.

  1. Manage Project
     1. Initiate project
     2. Conduct project
     3. Closeout project
  2. Do System Analysis
     1. Develop ConOps document
     2. Develop SRS
  3. Develop Software
     1. Develop system architecture
     3. Build CMS interop system
     4. Build web UI
     5. Build extended client systems (personal storage, PDA/smartphone UI)
     6. Build data storage system
  4. Verify System
     1. Develop test plan
     2. Develop test procedures
     3. Perform test procedures
     4. Maintain defect tracking system
  5. Validate System
     1. Perform traceability analysis
  6. Perform CM
     1. Keep documents in version control
     2. Manage changes to baselined documents
  7. Prepare Technical Publications
     1. Write system manual
     2. Write training materials
  8. Deliver System
     1. Perform user training
     2. Deploy system into customer's environment

* Team/WBS Mapping
  So far, our team is staffed to complete activities 1 and 2, with seemingly adequate plans to cover
  3 and 8.

  QA personnel are never mentioned in any of the case study documents.  I'd normally assume they
  will be provided by the JDI organization, but they aren't in the budget, either.  This leads me to
  believe that activities 4, 5, and 6 are unaccounted for.

  The other obvious gap is our technical documentation.  There is no staff plan for a technical
  writer, and this project is of suitable scope to warrant a full-time staff member for this task.
