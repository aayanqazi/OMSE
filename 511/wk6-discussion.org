# BECAUSE AN ASSIGNMENT IS DUE SUNDAY, REBUTTALS TO MAIN POSTS ARE OPTIONAL THIS WEEK.

# The SPM recognized that developing a visual schedule with inputs from most everyone on the team
# would achieve a high level of buy-in from everyone involved and thereby “jell” the team and keep
# everyone focused on project goals. A shared schedule would help everyone understand coordination
# signals, project hand-offs, and pressure points which in turn would motivate team members to help
# each other and achieve project success together.

# Upon completion of the WBS, the tasks and activities were estimated, a schedule developed and the
# staffing levels were updated. The general approach they took was as follows:

# a) Reviewed, validated and modified the WBS to ensure that all tasks, in particular, the healthcare
# and personal device elements, were duly allocated in the WBS

# b) Estimated all WBS elements (tasks) (size and effort as appropriate) and clearly identified all
# critical dependencies

# c) Developed a feasible schedule of tasks and a rationalized (“smooth”) staffing profile.

# With inputs from the requirements and development teams, they developed estimates of the total
# software size from the preliminary requirements gathered to date and the partially completed
# software design. Using the COCOMO model with the size estimates as input, a new schedule was
# produced by the end of the month in the form of a Gantt chart representing the main tasks
# distributed over the remaining time to complete the project. They were able to find a way to
# allocate tasks and resources to meet the original (next year’s) July 1st delivery date.

# This detailed planning and scheduling spread the original staffing profile out into later months
# allowing a larger peak staffing level later (by end of August) than earlier contemplated. The
# project would be staffed up to the maximum profile of 30 full-time JDI employees, including
# contracted consultants and specialists, plus the customer’s 4 programmers, for a total project
# staffing of 34. The software development team would be led by the SDM lead and deputy SDM.

# Discussion 6: Dependencies, Estimating, Scheduling, and Staffing, April

# This week you are tasked to review the schedule (see below) and look for opportunities to improve
# it. Discuss possibilities with your classmates and support your opinions with valid rationale.



* Missing/Vague Items
# a. Can you identify any tasks and dependencies that you think are missing or vague?


  
* Scheduling
# b. Are there any development tasks (e.g. requirements, design, construction, testing, etc.) that
# could be conducted concurrently, started early, or delayed to smooth staffing levels on this
# project?



* Critical Path
# c. Although few task dependencies are actually shown, are there any tasks that you think may be on
# the critical path?



* Management Tools
# d. What tools would you consider using to support WBS capture, estimating, and scheduling?
