Another month has passed and the SPM has a fairly solid idea of the scope, a feasible process, and a
start on the requirements.

The SPM and the Software Development Manager are now beginning to focus on refining the work
activities and tasks and map out a project schedule.

so far about this project:

a. What do you think are the critical milestones for this project (leverage your software process)?

b. What are the essential tasks that can be associated with specific technical deliverables (S/W,
H/W, Doc’n, Plans)?

c. What are the support activities that do not align with specific development activities but are
nevertheless essential to complete the project?

d. Is your project team missing any roles or competencies needed to support any of these activities
/ tasks?issing any roles or competencies needed to support any of these activities / tasks?
