<!--

Another month has passed and the SPM has a fairly solid idea of the scope, a feasible process, and a
start on the requirements.

The SPM and the Software Development Manager are now beginning to focus on refining the work
activities and tasks and map out a project schedule.

Discussion 4: Initializing the Plan, March

Let’s help the SPM identify the critical elements of the project plan. Consider everything you know
so far about this project:


-->

<h1>Critical Milestones</h1>
<!-- a. What do you think are the critical milestones for this project (leverage your software
    process)?  -->
<p>
   Milestones can be to satisfy contractual obligations; the contract requires us to deliver a fixed
   set of documents, so delivery events make natural milestones.  Other milestones may be to chart
   progress, and keep the customer apprised of the project status, so periodic test reports or
   builds can be thought of as milestones.  That gives us this list:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Specification delivery &ndash; SRS 1.0 baseline (first draft of system requirements)
  <li> Plan delivery &ndash; SPMP, SRP, SDP, STP, SQAP, SCMP 1.0 baselines (how we're going to
     produce the system described in the SRS)
  <li> Design delivery &ndash; SADD v1.0 baseline (Architecture and design of the software system)
  <li> Documentation/manual delivery
  <li> Incremental builds and reports (when available and suitable)
  <li> Customer training complete
  <li> Customer acceptance
</ul>


<h1>Essential Tasks</h1>
<!-- b. What are the essential tasks that can be associated with specific technical deliverables
     (S/W, H/W, Doc’n, Plans)? -->

<p>
  <b>Software</b> &mdash; The essential tasks associated with the making of finished software are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Requirements elicitation
  <li> Architecture/design
  <li> Component selection/acquisition
  <li> Implementation/integration
  <li> Verification/Validation
  <li> Defect tracking
  <li> Gathering feedback
  <li> Deployment
  <li> Maintenance
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Hardware</b> &mdash; In general, this list would look a lot like the last one.  For this
  specific project, we're not building hardware, but we'll be buying some to run the finished
  software.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Requirements elicitation
  <li> Vendor selection
  <li> Acquisition/acceptance
  <li> Installation/configuration
  <li> Maintenance
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Documentation</b> &mdash; I'm not sure if this is in reference to end-user documentation
  (e.g. the manual) or project documentation; I'll assume the latter.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Requirements elicitation
  <li> Architecture/design
  <li> Project planning
  <li> Change control/configuration management
</ul>


<p>
  <b>Plans</b> &mdash; This includes all the documents whose acronyms end with a P.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Requirements elicitation
  <li> Project planning
</ul>


<h1>Support Activities</h1>
<!-- c. What are the support activities that do not align with specific development activities but
     are nevertheless essential to complete the project? -->

<p>
  Measurement doesn't directly contribute to any of the technical deliverables, but is essential for
  making informed decisions.  Infrastructure activities, like IT, office administration, and
  facilities maintenance fit this description as well.
</p>

<p>
   Fairley also mentions QA, the CCB, and version control.
</p>



<h1>Missing Roles/Competencies</h1>
<!-- d. Is your project team missing any roles or competencies needed to support any of these
     activities / tasks? -->

<p>
   We still haven't hired our domain experts.  I see this as a major bottleneck for getting good
   requirements, especially for HIPAA compliance.
</p>

<p>
   Now that requirements work has started, we'll need to fill our remaining analyst slots, but this
   doesn't appear to be a major problem.  We probably won't need our other admin support.  
</p>

<p>
   The only other thing I worry about is configuration management.  Not long from now, we'll be
   releasing some of our documents to the customer, and we'll be getting feedback and changes.  I'm
   not sure if this is something the SPM can manage, or if we need dedicated personnel.
</p>



<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote><i>
requirement gathering is an independent task that happens with no direct connection to the SW/HW
</i></blockquote>

<p>
  I disagree. While you could say that, you could also say that requirements are the foundation of
  any development effort. Just because they affect more than one deliverable doesn't mean
  elicitation is a "support" activity.
</p>

<p>
  Putting together a ConOps document is a very general task, but developing a technical spec from
  that is almost design &mdash; you're deciding what's hardware and what's software, and setting the
  tone for the architecture.  I don't think you can separate requirements out and say it's not
  related to a deliverable.
</p>


<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<blockquote><i> I don't believe we have anyone assigned or picked for Configuration Management, Tool
      Development. </i></blockquote>

<p>
   This concerns me also.  In my experience, you can spend as much time as you want to on CM, and
   shepherding internal tools is a full-time job.  We probably need someone to have these tasks as
   their primary responsibilities, though that wasn't in the staff plan.
