\section{Overview and Project Summary}
\todo[inline]{This section of the plan should provide an overview of the entire project. Provide a brief introductory statement about the project here.
The Advanced E-Healthcare System (AEHS) is a major overhaul of the automated systems in use by the Columbia Healthcare Group. }

\subsection{Purpose, Context, Scope of Requirements, and Objectives}
\todo[inline]{Summarize the primary purpose, scope and objectives of the project.  When describing scope, express it by summarizing the requirements and how they may relate to the overall project context such as existing systems and operations.  When addressing context, identify key project stakeholders (customer, users, other affected people or companies), nature of the problem being addressed, and general approach that will be use to address the problem.}


\subsection{Assumptions, Constraints and Dependencies}
\todo[inline]{What are your known and/or assumed project priorities, constraints and dependencies?  Briefly address factors such as schedule, budget, requirements, tools, infrastructure and human resources available as well as systems, interfaces, software, and technology to be used.  Use a flexibility matrix to illustrate how you will balance the various project priorities.  }

\subsection{Project Deliverables}
\todo[inline]{Identify internal and external (customer) project deliverables including dates and/or project milestones.  Include internal plans and reports as well as customer deliverables such as documents, scripts, source code, executables on CD, database tables. Note that some of these documents may be provided to the customer and your own management as well as the team.  }


\subsection{Summary of Schedule and Budget}
\todo[inline]{Provide a top level description of the schedule and budget with major activities and milestones – leave the details to the appropriate sections below.}


\subsection{Evolution of this SPMP}
\todo[inline]{You should say something about how you plan to evolve the SPMP.  When do you plan to revisit it and update it?  How will you review and approve this document as you progress through project phases? }


\section{References}
\todo[inline]{You should also include a list of all key documents, web and other resources used and referenced in the project.  Don’t forget to keep this up-to-date with each significant release of the SPMP. }



\section{Definitions}
\todo[inline]{This should be a short list of unique project-specific key definitions and
  acronyms. Don’t include common terms like SPMP, SRS, SQA, SCM here (assume that all readers will
  know these). Remember that good practice is to define commonly used acronyms in (parentheses) the
  first time you use them (the title of this document illustrates this good practice).  }



\section{Project Organization}
\subsection{Organizational Interfaces (Internal and External)}
\todo[inline]{Show how you plan to organize your team to carry out the activities and tasks identified above.  You should include an organization chart showing your team member’s roles and responsibilities and how they relate to each other.  You can also show “interfaces” to your customer, users (if applicable), your “senior management”, and others supporting your project.  Identify and describe internal organizational units/teams (e.g. requirements, design, development, integration, testing, SQA, SCM, etc.) as well as external organizations and essential contact information (e.g. customers, users, contractors, vendors etc.) }


\subsection{Project Roles and Responsibilities}
\todo[inline]{Describe the roles and responsibilities of all teams and team members, if applicable, including those of external participants.}



\section{Technical Processes}
\subsection{Process Model}
\todo[inline]{What is the process model you plan to follow (Waterfall, Incremental Delivery, Evolutionary, XP, Spiral)?  You should clearly identify your main phases, activities and milestones.  You should clearly show what you expect to achieve and deliver by each milestone, and by what date (a milestone every 2 weeks is reasonable).  At a minimum, your activities should include those for establishing the customer’s requirements, setting up your development environment, your architecture and design activities, coding, integration, and testing, and achieving customer acceptance.  }


\subsection{Methods, Tools and Techniques}
\todo[inline]{What processes and methods do you plan to use to specify your architecture / design, develop your code, create your builds, test your modules and subsystems, and deploy your deliverable software?  }
\subsection{Development Environment and Infrastructure}
\todo[inline]{Describe your development environment identifying the tools, languages, operating systems, and utilities (e.g. bug tracking) that will support your methods and tools above.}
\subsection{Acceptance Process}
\todo[inline]{Describe the process you will use to accept deliverables including software and documentation.  }
