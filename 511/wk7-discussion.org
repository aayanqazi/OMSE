* Problem Statement                                               :noexport:

  Although development has been fairly nimble and adaptive to customer needs, it has also been more
  fairly ad hoc in a few respects.  The following problems have been observed by the SPM and SDMs:

  - Integration builds rarely compile the first few times and when they do they are already breaking
    under fairly light testing
  - Developers are doing a lot of debugging and rework rather than new development
  - There is growing concern that there will not be enough time to do solid integration testing
    before the final acceptance testing and deployment phases of the project
  - Because of time pressure, developers are devoting less time to desk-checking and performing
    little or weak unit testing before releasing software components into integration and system
    test
  - The SDM's are becoming bottlenecks because they are doing the integration work having come from
    a "chief-programmer" mind-set
  - The overall concern is that the above problems will lead to missing delivery dates and
    compromising software quality.

  Both the SPM and the SDMs want to adopt more repeatable processes while avoiding excessive process
  ceremony that would unnecessarily burden the team.  It has decided to separate software
  development onto two fairly independent but closely coordinated software development groups.  One
  team will be led by the existing ("lead") Software Development Manager, and the other will be led
  by the SDM's "deputy".  The two SDMs will share resources as required â€“ fairly evenly for the most
  part.  The lead SDM and her team will focus on all the healthcare application subsystems and
  services including the underlying healthcare database.  The deputy SDM and his team will finalize
  the foundation software elements (O.S., DBMS, and web services) and lead the effort to develop
  appointment scheduling and forms management applications as well as mobile communications
  development and personal device applications.  The teams are using Subversion to control software
  revisions and JDI's coding standards.  The design is being documented using UML templates in
  Visio.  The designers have been providing technical specs to the two software development managers
  who have been assigning tasks to individual developers on each team.

  They also established an independent integration and test team by reallocating some developers
  with integration and testing experience from the software development teams.  This independent
  testing team will initially consist of a test lead plus 3 test engineers.  Once the requirements
  have been baselined, the plan is to move three of the requirements analysts onto the test team to
  increase the test team to 7 in all.

  See Case Study Learning Module, OrgChart(Sept), which illustrates the organizational changes.

  Discussion 7.2: Improvements to the Development Process, September

  This discussion focuses on processes that you would consider injecting into the project to address
  the problems addressed above, and any others that may occur to you.  Bring your own experiences
  into the discussion.


* Separate Integration/Test Team
  /a. What do you think of the above strategy of creating a separate integration and test team (both
  benefits and challenges)?/

  Adding a test/integration team to the project seems like a good idea, though 

  The most obvious benefit is that we have a test group at all, which is something I was concerned
  about from the first personnel plan.  I also believe that starting to test this early in the
  development process will be good in several ways, including higher end-product quality.  Having
  that kind of test support will also help the confidence of the engineers, who seem to need it.

  On the negative side, filling out the test group with requirements engineers may be convenient
  from a personnel standpoint, but these people may not have the skills or mindset to be really
  great testers.  For the same reason, I'm concerned about mixing development (integration) and test
  responsibilities in the same group.

* Processes and Tools for I/T Team
  /b.  What integration and testing processes and tools would you introduce into this team?/

  It almost goes without saying that this team needs access to a defect-tracking system.  They'll
  also need a hardware setup equivalent to the intended installation for the customer.

  I'd also recommend the use of metrics for this group, since all the other software work products
  flow through them.  We should focus on those metrics that relate to the 'ilities' required by the
  customer, such as throughput, response time, and trends in the defect database.

* Processes at Large
  /c.  What processes would you integrate into the software development teams and the project team
  at large to increase software quality and counter some of the problems outlined above?/

  I'd recommend starting a continuous-integration system that will perform builds on every checkin.
  This tightens the feedback loop for build problems; the engineers can know within minutes, rather
  than waiting until it's time to provide a build for the customer.

  Removing the SDM bottleneck for integration will relieve some of the time pressure from the
  developers, but it should be made clear that sending a feature to integration without making sure
  it works is not good practice.
** TODO What metric works here?

* TODO Introducing Changes
  /d.  In what order would you introduce changes and how quickly would you introduce them?/
