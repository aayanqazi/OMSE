  Information Hiding: What effect does information hiding have on maintenance of programs? Why is it
  important to design for maintenance?
  
* My post
  Second question first: 90% of a system's lifetime is spent in the maintenance cycle.  Since we'll
  be spending most of our time there, our lives would be easier if we planned for it.

  One of the benefits of IH is that the hard or likely-to-change design decisions are captured and
  contained in one place ("module" in Parnas papers).  In other words, the things are likely to come
  up when /maintaining the system/ are each self-contained and isolated from the rest of the system.
  IH makes maintenance easier by allowing maintenance changes to be more surgical and lower-risk.
