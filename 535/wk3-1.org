  /Responsibility for Code: Who is responsible for the quality of the code? Why? Who should have the
  final say about the acceptability of the code for release? Why?/

  It depends on the structure of the team.

  In a classic organization with an engineering team and a QA team, code quality is the
  responsibility of the programmers (since they're the only ones allowed to change it), while QA
  holds responsibility for certifying that the code is ready for release (since they're doing all
  the bug-finding).

  In a more agile organization, the test and programming functions are more mixed together, so the
  team as a whole is responsible for the quality of both code and release.
