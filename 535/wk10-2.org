Project I Output

  /Project Part I Output: Discuss the tools researched individually as part of the course
  project. What tools did you find useful? Why?/

  As far as what was presented in class, I was particularly interested in John's presentation on
  TestComplete (oh, and thanks for dropping my name, John).  We're looking into automating some of
  our testing, and this tool might work well for our SQA team as well.  FxCop and NCover being .NET
  tools, we won't be able to use them, but it's still interesting to see what's possible on other
  platforms.

  The tool I reported on was Visual Assist X, a plugin for Visual Studio that enhances Intellisense
  and syntax highlighting and provides some code navigation and refactoring tools.  I've enjoyed
  using this tool, and I was glad of the opportunite to evangelize a little.  It would be difficult
  for me to work without it at this point.
