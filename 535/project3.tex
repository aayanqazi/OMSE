\section{Analysis}

\subsection{\#1}
This is a degenerate case of this class of defect.  The \texttt{push} function takes one parameter,
\texttt{stackinput}, but the name of that parameter is not designated as input or output.  In order
to follow conventions, the signature of this function should be changed to the following:

\begin{verbatim}
   void push(int stackinput_I);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\#2}
The names \texttt{push}, \texttt{pop}, and \texttt{isempty} are very common.  C does not support
namespaces for code organization, so the idiomatic approach is to use name prefixes.  It is
recommended to replace these names with the following:

\begin{verbatim}
   void stackPush(int stackinput_I);
   int  stackPop(void);
   int  stackIsempty(void);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{\#3}
There are some circumstances where \texttt{malloc} could return \texttt{NULL}.  These include
virtual address space exhaustion, or low-memory conditions on platforms that don't support memory
virtualization.  Though these cases are rare, this is a utility library, so it's not guaranteed this
code will not be run in those conditions, so it's best to safely handle these cases, and log that
event for diagnostic purposes.  The recommended resolution to this defect is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
   struct stackelement *newnode = malloc(sizeof (struct stackelement));
   assert(newnode);
   if (newnode) {
      newnode->stackdata = stackinput;
      newnode->next= stacktop;
      
      stacktop = newnode;
   }
\end{verbatim}
