* Agenda
  - [X] Basecamp
  - [X] PMP
  - [X] Talk about strategy for other deliverables
        
* Basecamp
  - Works fine as a point of collaboration
  - Doesn't look like a good tool for producing a PMP
  - Will probably use for managing the project

* Strategy for deliverables
  - Delegate one document to each team member
    - Need to okay this idea with Andy
  - All of us working on the same document doesn't seem to work
  - Could probably get first drafts done in a week if we parallelize

* Wednesday meetup
  - Ben can't make it

* Action items
  - Consult Andy on: (Ben)
    - New deliverable strategy
    - Assumptions about size/form of documents
    - Slides/plan for Wednesday meetup
  - Solid rough draft of documents by next Saturday (all)

* Next Meeting
  - Wednesday, 9:30pm (after group meetup)
  - Agenda
    - Document progress
    - Debrief of the meetup
