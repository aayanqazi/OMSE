  /Where would you place yourself on Bennett's continuum?  Where would you place the other members on
  your distributed team (in your actual workplace)?/

  /Are there simlarities or differences in how you think team members perceive differences on the
  team?/

  /Do you have examples of times when conflict turned productive and yielded new ideas?  Examples of
  times when conflict was not managed well?  How do you think that you -- as a distributed team
  leader -- might find the balance between cultural difference, conflict, and creative potential on
  your team?/
