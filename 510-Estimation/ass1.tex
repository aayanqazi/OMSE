\begin{document}

You are working with a development team on a large software project.  The project is creating a web
based three-dimensional modeling tool.  This system will allow registered users to create and
manipulate three-dimensional objects via a web browser.  Because this is a project with a great deal
of high-level (shareholder) interest, the team has been instructed to provide estimates for the
project at each stage of the software development life cycle.

Your job is not to help the team estimate the project but to help the team minimize the factors that
add to the uncertainty of their estimates at each stage of the project.  So for each stage of the
software development life cycle (you may assume a waterfall type life cycle), describe the factors
that you think will contribute to the uncertainty of the team’s estimate and why the factor impacts
the reliability of the estimate.  Then describe what the team can do to minimize the effect of the
given factors.  If there is no way to minimize the effect of a factor, explain why that is the case.

Please submit your recommendations to the team in a Word document via Blackboard’s assignment
mechanism.

Please contact Chris Gilmore (via email or Blackboard) for any questions you may have about the
assignment.
