  This is a role-playing assignment designed to simulate the launch of a principled negotiation
  process between a customer (Columbia) and a software contractor (JSI). The discussion aims to
  discover where the points of flexibility appear in both the problem and solution spaces. The
  purpose of this discussion is not to develop a new estimate for the project. Rather, the principle
  aim is to:

  (a)  Define a short-list of prioritized project functions, features, and attributes (reqts) that
  will meet Columbia’s needs

  (b) Define a list of feasible development and delivery (tech) options that JDI will implement to
  meet project needs

  (c) Agree to mutually acceptable prioritized requirements and technical options to reduce the
  “cone of uncertainty”.

  Comment: This problem-solving exercise represents the first significant step exposing the key
  points of flexibility, namely, Columbia’s prioritized needs, and JDI’s technical options. The next
  steps (which you are not being asked to explore) are to reduce project uncertainties wherever
  possible, develop a new estimate, and make a mutual commitment to plan the project.

  Discussion Teams and Threads

  The class will be organized into discussion teams (A, B, C, etc.), each with a designated captain,
  and each divided into two sub-teams:

  + Non-Technical Sub-Team: The customer and users driven by user and customer needs
  + Technical Sub-Team: The SPM, requirements, architect, and development leads by technical
    solution options

  Note that senior management and the head of marketing, though stakeholders, have not been included
  in this exercise.

  Three discussion threads will be set up for each team by your instructor: one for each sub-team and
  a third “negotiation” thread to be used for the purpose of converging on a consensus:

  1. During the first day or two of this week everyone needs to become thoroughly familiar with the
     principled negotiation process as well as Columbia’s requirements and contract (below) [review
     Ch 23 and key points];
 2. By Thursday midnight each sub-team should have agreed and discussed where they believe their
    flexibilities lay: a. The non-technical sub-team is to determine Columbia’s project priorities
    b. The technical sub-team is to identify feasible development and delivery options

 3. Over the subsequent three (3) days the sub-teams are to review each others’ areas of
    flexibility, identify consistencies and inconsistencies between priorities and options, achieve
    consensus if possible, and but identify unresolved issues as “pending” problems. By Sunday
    evening (say by 8 pm) the sub-teams should complete this phase of their work.

 4. The appointed team captain is to post a “consolidated” result from these inputs by Sunday
    midnight or Monday noon at the latest.

  Your main challenge will be to predict areas where you will be able to provide technical options
  to fit customer/user priorities.
  
* Initial response
  McConnell gives a great list of generic options on page 267.  Here are the ones I think are most
  applicable:
