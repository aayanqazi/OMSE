* FP                                                               :noexport:
  Here's the raw data I used to generate my FP numbers. It's mostly a quick judgement call with
  round numbers. These are the counts of the features, not FP.

* COCOMO Factors
** Intro                                                           :noexport:
   Hi All -

   The adjustment factors that we each chose for the COCOMO model followed our discussion from the
   previous week, but there were still some differences.

   The most glaring was the SITE value. We each had a different adjustment factor ranging from VL to
   VH. I think there is some confusion about this point that we should clear up before the next
   estimation round.

   The other differences were not that drastic and were as follows:

   DATA - VH(3), H(1)
   DOCU - VH(3), H(1)
   PCON - VH(3), H(1)
   LTEX - VH(1), H(3)
   TOOL - H(3), L(1) - there might be some confus here too
   SCED - VL(1), N(3)


   The Scaling Factors for the COCOMO model were the same except for:
   RESL - H(3), N(1) 
** Response
   Most of my ratings were just continuations from two weeks ago. 

   - *SITE* -- I rated this VH because it had the lowest multiplier.  Our team works in the same
     space, so there shouldn't be any penalty.
   - *DATA* -- Our database will include data for a /million/ patients. I rated this VH.
   - *DOCU* -- I rated this VH, since that's what we agreed on two weeks ago.
   - *PCON* -- I gave this a VH; we're not likely to have a lot of turnover.
   - *LTEX* -- H.
