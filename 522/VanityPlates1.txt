Assignment:
Imagine that you have been charged with implementing the GUI and input checking associated with step 1 of the attached application form for an Oregon Vanity Plate.

Is the description as given suitable as a software specification? If not, what kinds of changes need to be made?

If you find it easier to just rewrite the specification, feel free. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules:
>0 numbers
>0 letters
At most one half-space or half-hyphen checked
reject:
        \d{3}\w{3}
        \w{3}\d{3}
        [^ -\w\d]


--------------------
"Clear writing"?
Space/half-hyphen positioning: before/after all positions? Only internal?
Not clear whether spaces or full hyphens are valid characters (rules e and f collide)
Is this a UI for an end user, or the guy doing data entry for the form?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leaving aside the inherent ambiguity of using English for specifications, there are several issues with this text as a specification:

* It's not clear which are valid positions for half-spaces or half-hyphens. Can you place a half-hyphen before the first character? A space after the last?

* Are spaces and (full) hyphens valid characters to put in a box? Depending on the answer to this question, either (e) or (f) is erroneous.

* There is no way for a machine to validate the quality of the applicant's handwriting.

Rules (a), (b), and (c), on the other hand, are actually fairly well-written requirements, although they all depend on the allowable set of characters (i.e. is lower-case allowed?).
