% Problems 6.5.1, 7.8.1, 7.8.2, and 7.8.4 from The Way of Z.

% Please do the problems as best as you can. 6.5.1 is pretty open-ended; we're not looking for some
% picayune detail, but for an important missing component of the specification. The use of pencil
% and paper plus a scanner is encouraged for 7.8.1 and 7.8.2, but you may also use LaTeX or any
% standard ASCII Z notation.
