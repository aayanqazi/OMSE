% Problems 6.5.1, 7.8.1, 7.8.2, and 7.8.4 from The Way of Z.

% Please do the problems as best as you can. 6.5.1 is pretty open-ended; we're not looking for some
% picayune detail, but for an important missing component of the specification. The use of pencil
% and paper plus a scanner is encouraged for 7.8.1 and 7.8.2, but you may also use LaTeX or any
% standard ASCII Z notation.

\section{Problem 6.5.1}
\begin{quote} \textit{
    Something very important was left out of our state machine model. What was it? (It can be
    expressed in terms of the states and events we already defined.)
  } \end{quote}

There's no initial state. (Aside: this is given in Appendix F of the book.)

\section{Problem 7.8.1}

\begin{quote}
  \textit{Define the total operations T\_Backward and T\_Delete.  You may use any functions or
    operators defined in Appendix D. }
\end{quote}

\section{Problem 7.8.2}

\begin{quote}
  \textit{Define the operation that handles input characters that are not handled by Insert,
    Forward, Backward, and Delete.}
\end{quote}


\section{Problem 7.8.4}

\begin{quote}
  \textit{How many distinct states are described by the Editor schema? The EOF schema? Assume that
    CHAR is implemented by the ASCII character set.}
\end{quote}
