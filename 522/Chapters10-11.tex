  {\it Consider expressing case analyses using equivalence.  Compare this efinition of temperature
    and phase to the previous one.  Which logical connective is used to separate cases? What happens
    at $temp = 0$? At $temp = 100$?
    \begin{axdef}
      temp : TEMP \\
      phase : PHASE
      \where
      temp \leq 0 \iff phase = solid \\
      0 \leq temp < 100 \iff phase = liquid \\
      temp > 100 \iff phase = gas
    \end{axdef}

\begin{quote}
  {\it Write the table of situations that satisfies each of these predicates.  Would these make
    reasonable saety requirements?

    \[ beam = on \iff door = closed \also
     beam = on \land door = closed \also
     beam = on \lor door = open \also
     beam = off \lor door = closed \]

\section{Exercise 10.6.1}
% 10.6.1 10min
\begin{quote}
  {\it Define the relation $phase_R$ from temperature to phase, consistent with the definitions of
    $temp$ and $phase$ in section 10.4.2. }
\end{quote}


\section{Exercise 10.8.1}
% 10.8.1 5min
\begin{quote}
  {\it What is the meaning of this predicate when $f x$ is undefined? When $f x$ is defined?
  \[ x \in \dom f \implies f  x = y \] }

\begin{quote}
  {\it Define the set of points within the rectangular $window$ whose lower left and upper right
    corners are points modelled by pairs of integers $(x_l, y_l)$ and $(x_u, y_u)$, respectively.
    Then define $segment$, the portion of the previously defined $line$ that lies within $window$. }

\section{Exercise 11.3.1}
% 11.3.1 5min
\begin{quote}
  {\it Is our second definition of $PRIME$ a constructive definition?  Could this definition be
    translated to an executable program in some suitable language? }

\begin{quote}
