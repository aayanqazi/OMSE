\section{Exercise 10.4.4.2}
% 10.4.4.2 15min
\begin{quote}
  {\it Consider expressing case analyses using equivalence.  Compare this definition of temperature
    and phase to the previous one.  Which logical connective is used to separate cases? What happens
    at $temp = 0$? At $temp = 100$?
    \begin{axdef}
      temp : TEMP \\
      phase : PHASE
      \where
      temp \leq 0 \iff phase = solid \\
      0 \leq temp < 100 \iff phase = liquid \\
      temp > 100 \iff phase = gas
    \end{axdef}
  }
\end{quote}

There are two areas of concern with this definition.  The first concerns the use of equivalence in
the definition, which appears to be correct.  Take the first line:
\[ temp \leq 0 \iff phase = solid \]
which expands to:
\[ (temp \leq 0 \implies phase = solid) \land (temp > 0 \implies phase \neq solid) \land \also
   (phase = solid \implies temp \leq 0) \land (phase \neq solid \implies temp > 0)\]
This is correct, but since the other statements cover the cases where $temp > 0$, the additional
restrictions provided by $\iff$ aren't really necessary.

The second area of concern is the coverage of $temp$.  It appears that two of the statements apply
at $temp = 0$ ($(phase = solid) \land (phase = liquid)$, which is mathematically impossible), and
none apply when $temp = 100$.

  {\it Write the table of situations that satisfies each of these predicates.  Would these make
    reasonable saety requirements?

    \begin{eqnarray}
      beam = on  & \iff  & door = closed \\
      beam = on  & \land & door = closed \\
      beam = on  & \lor  & door = open   \\
      beam = off & \lor  & door = closed
    \end{eqnarray}
  }

(1) -- This is the condition where the beam turns on as soon as the
door closes.  This is the opposite of a good safety requirement.
