\section{Problem 8.2.4.1}
\begin{quote}
  {\it
    Is this an erroneous expression? Why or why not?
    \[ \{red, green\} \union yellow \]
  }
\end{quote}

It depends on the definition of $red$, $green$, and $yellow$.  With the book's definitions, this is
certainly an error, since the $\union$ operator must have sets on both sides, and $yellow$ is not a set.
