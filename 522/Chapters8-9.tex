\section{Problem 8.2.4.1}
\begin{quote}
  {\it
    Is this an erroneous expression?  Why or why not?
    \[ \{red, green\} \union yellow \]
  }
\end{quote}
% 8.2.4.1 1 min
With the book's definitions, this is certainly an error, since the $\union$ operator must have sets
on both sides, and $yellow$ is not a set.



\section{Problem 9.3.3.1}
\begin{quote}
  {\it Write a fully formal defintiion of the} dept {\it relation that does not use the three dots.}
\end{quote}
% 9.3.3.1 3 min [hint: doing it "the long way" would be silly]

First we need to define some schemas that handle the cases for the individual departments.

\begin{schema}{AdminPhone}
  PHONE \\
  DEPARTMENT \\
  num?  : PHONE 
  \where
  num?  \in \{0000 ..  0999\} \\
  num?  \mapsto administration
\end{schema}

\begin{schema}{ResearchPhone}
  PHONE \\
  DEPARTMENT \\
  num?  : PHONE 
  \where
  num?  \in \{4000 ..  4999\} \\
  num?  \mapsto research
\end{schema}

\begin{schema}{ManufacturingPhone}
  PHONE \\
  DEPARTMENT \\
  num?  : PHONE 
  \where
  num?  \in \{6000 ..  6999\} \\
  num?  \mapsto manufacturing
\end{schema}

Now we're ready to define $dept$ by combining all these schemas:

\[ dept \defs AdminPhone \lor ResearchPhone \lor ManufacturingPhone \]

Note that $dept$ is only a partial function; for example, $dept(1000)$ is undefined.

\begin{quote}
  {\it The second elevator leaves the first floor and stops at the third floor while all the other
    elevators remain in place.  This new configuration is named $floor'$.  Define $floor'$ in terms
    of $floor$.}
