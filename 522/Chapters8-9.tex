\section{Problem 8.2.4.1}
\begin{quote}
  {\it
    Is this an erroneous expression?  Why or why not?
    \[ \{red, green\} \union yellow \]
  }
\end{quote}
% 8.2.4.1 1 min
With the book's definitions, this is certainly an error, since the $\union$ operator must have sets
on both sides, and $yellow$ is not a set.



\section{Problem 9.3.3.1}
\begin{quote}
  {\it Write a fully formal defintiion of the} dept {\it relation that does not use the three dots.}
\end{quote}
% 9.3.3.1 3 min [hint: doing it "the long way" would be silly]

I'm not sure how I would have solved this before reading Chapter 10.  The function $dept$ can be
defined thus:

\begin{axdef}
  dept \_ : PHONE \rel DEPARTMENT
  \where
  (0000 \leq \_ \leq 0999 \land \_ \mapsto administration) \lor \\
  (4000 \leq \_ \leq 4999 \land \_ \mapsto research) \lor \\
  (6000 \leq \_ \leq 6999 \land \_ \mapsto manufacturing)
\end{axdef}


\section{Problem 9.3.4.1}
\begin{quote}
  {\it Define the} parent {\it relation: Abraham and Sarah are the parents of Isaac, etc.}

\end{quote}
% 9.3.4.1 10 min

There doesn't seem to be a way to generically specify this, so I fell back on just listing the
members of the set:

\begin{axdef}
  parent : PERSON \rel PERSON \cross PERSON
  \where
  parent = \{ \\
  ishmael \mapsto (hagar, abraham), \\
  isaac \mapsto (abraham, sarah), \\
  esau \mapsto (isaac, rebekah), \\
  jacob \mapsto (isaac, rebekah) \\
  \}
\end{axdef}

\section{Problem 9.4.1}
\begin{quote}
  {\it The second elevator leaves the first floor and stops at the third floor while all the other
    elevators remain in place.  This new configuration is named $floor'$.  Define $floor'$ in terms
    of $floor$.}

\end{quote}
