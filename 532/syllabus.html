<h1>OMSE 532 | <i>Software Architecture and Domain Analysis</i><em>&nbsp;</em></h1>
<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
<p>Methods and principles of the architectural design of complex, large-scale software systems to accommodate change and evolution through many product releases or versions.&nbsp;Survey of the major architectural styles, their strengths and weaknesses, and architectural trade-offs with respect to system goals and desired properties.&nbsp;Study of architectural approach to development of open systems and frameworks based on case studies.&nbsp;Software engineering of domain-specific software architectures for families of systems (e.g., product lines) including domain analysis, domain modeling, and design of domain specific software architectures.&nbsp;Relation of software architecture to requirements and its effects on downstream design and software evolution.&nbsp;Students examine domain analysis and the architectural design process and products in the business context including the effects of decisions on cost and schedule.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>The architectural design of complex, long-lived systems or families of systems is fundamental to efficient, reliable software production, and fundamentally different from small-grain design issues. The field of "software architecture" continues development that can be traced back at least to&nbsp;DeRemer&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Kron's&nbsp;"Programming in the Large vs. Programming in the Small,&rdquo;&nbsp;Parnas&rsquo;s&nbsp;"On the Criteria for Decomposing Programs into Modules" and related papers. Today there is wide recognition of the opportunity for exploiting architectural principles to address a variety of software engineering issues including development of common platforms, reduced cycle time, improved maintainability, in decreased production cost.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>On completion of the architecture and design course, students shall understand principles of software architecture and their application, and shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the practical application of architectural concepts in software engineering.</li>
<li>Develop a clear understanding of which concerns properly belong to software architecture (and which do not).</li>
<li>Understand principles of architectural design by applying them on a small scale.</li>
<li>Become familiar with common architectural styles: understand what distinguishes one style from another and the tradeoffs involved in using a particular style.</li>
<li>Understand how to evaluate existing or proposed architecture for suitability to task</li>
<li>Understand how to apply architectural design principles to support evolutionary system development (systematic reuse, lower-cost, faster time-to-market, higher quality).</li>
</ul>
<p>Students finishing this course are not expected to immediately become lead software architects, but will have background knowledge and skills that will prepare them to acquire architectural expertise in a particular application domain through work experience.</p>
<h2>Required Text</h2>
<p><i>Software Architecture in Practice&nbsp;</i>(Second Edition), by Len Bass, Paul Clements, and Rick&nbsp;Kazman.&nbsp;Addison-Wesley (SEI series in software engineering), 2003.&nbsp;ISBN 0321154959</p>
<h2>Additional Readings</h2>
<p>Additional readings (e.g., seminal papers) may be assigned&nbsp;throughout the course. All of these materials will be provided as downloads from the course web page.</p>
<h2>Summary of Assignments</h2>
<p>Students should be prepared to discuss the readings each week. Students must also complete a number of small exercises. An assignment will exercise will typically be given out during one class session and due one or two weeks later.</p>
<p>In the second half of the course, students will participate in helping to develop&nbsp;a software&nbsp;architecture for a small system. Students go through the steps of extending a domain, analyzing commonality, and applying principles of architectural design to extend an existing architecture to encompass the evolving product domain.</p>
<p>A midterm examination will be given in approximately week 5. It will be a take-home examination, due one week after it is handed out. A final examination, also take-home, will be given the last week of class.</p>
<h2>Resource requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Students are expected to have access to the&nbsp;internet, a PSU Odin account, D2L, and Microsoft Word.</p>
<h2>Topics Outline</h2>
