* Notes
** Commonalities
   - Wind speed only
   - Fixed period for transmission
   - Weighted average
   - Device: sensors (1+)
   - Device: radio
   - Each sensor has a driver and ID
   - Each sensor indicates its reliability
** Variabilities
   - Weights and sample count for weighted average algorithm
   - Message format
   - Transmission period
   - Scan rate
   - Count/type of sensor
   - Resolution of sensor
   - Sensor hardware
   - radio hardware
   - reliability indicator
** Issues
   - Message formats: 2 for now, possibly more later
   - No other sensor types, wind speed only
