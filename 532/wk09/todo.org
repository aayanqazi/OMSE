        Overall goal of the assignment is to develop a common architecture for
        the FWS family.

        This week, ypu should develop the module structure using the common
        version of the commonality analysis (dowload). Produce the following;

        - A module guide for the FWS architecture giving a brief prose
          description of the secret of each module. Produce the module guide
          by filling in missing parts of the Module Guide template.
        - The guide should describe any design issues that arise 
        - Interface specifications: a sketch of the leaf module interfaces
          describing:
          - The service(s) provided by the module
          - Secret(s) of the module
          - Associated variabilities
