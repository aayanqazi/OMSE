The architectural business cycle (ABC) exists whether an organization pays any
attention to it or not. That is, the architectures of a system tend to
influence the things that influence it. The only issue is whether we are
attempting to control those influences to achieve particular goals, or simply
allowing them to happen.

For this question, please think of an example illustrating the ABC from your
work experiences.  Try to think of a case where certain architectural design
decisions had downstream effects (e.g., the design made it difficult to add a
feature later) or previous decisions affected the form of the architecture
(e.g., the form of the organization determined the form of the architecture).

You may give an example where these influences resulted in unintended
consequences or where good control resulted in the desired effect.
