\section{Business Rationale}

Spam volumes are continuing to increase, and ABC has identified a product
opportunity.  Developing a spam-filtering tool to add to our product line
would allow us to serve our existing customers better, since they've been
asking for this feature for some time.  This tool would also enrich our
package of solutions, so we could make a more compelling case for new accounts
as well.

\todo[inline]{Finish this.}

\section{Architectural Design Goals}

In order to fully meet the needs of the customer as well as allow future
versions of this product to be developed, the architecture will be developed
towards the following criteria.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Standards Compliancy.}

  ABC has a long tradition of developing its products in a standrds-compliant
  way, so that they will interoperate with \textit{all} related products, not
  just those sold by ABC.  ABC has no interest in entering the market of
  proprietary email products.

\item \textbf{Extensibility.}

  Spam evolves, and this product must be capable of adapting as time goes on.
  This includes future product updates, as well as customization of an
  installed system.

\item \textbf{Performance.}

  Email is a mission-critical service, and some of the customers requesting
  this product have very high email volumes.  The use of this system
  \textit{must not} adversely affect the day-to-day business of the company
  that purchased it, which means that per-message latency must be kept to a
  minimum.  

\end{enumerate}
