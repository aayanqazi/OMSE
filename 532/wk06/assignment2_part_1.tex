The following structures are used to document the system architecture.  Each
view of the system satisfies the needs of a particular architectural driver,
and is intended for a specific audience.

\subsection{Modify filtering algorithms}
A key business goal is to be able to perform hot updates to customer’s spam
filter applications. This includes being able to modify the algorithms
implementing spam filtering criteria, add new ones, and remove old ones.
 
Following the scheme in the text, this property would be a type of
modifiability. More specifically, it is the ability to change, extend, or
contract the spam filtering algorithms at run time (binding time). This sort
of modification is a form of perfective maintenance.

\textbf{Source} --- Spam filter developer/maintainer responsible for
perfective maintenance of the filtering algorithms.

\textbf{Stimulus} --- Change the run-time the spam filtering criteria by
adding, removing, or modifying one of the spam filtering algorithms.

\textbf{Artifact} --- This scenario applies to modifying the spam filtering
criteria based on the existing system context (inputs, outputs, and
platform). For example, adding a new filtering algorithm to a set of
algorithms that operate on the client’s inbox. (I.e., this does not include
more general modifications such as adding new sources of input or output, or
changing the platform the system runs on.)

\textbf{Environment} --- Hot-patch: updates must be made to the customer’s
system on site while the spam filter and mail client are running. If the spam
filter software must shut down to complete the update then it must
automatically re- start itself.

\textbf{Response} --- Maintainers identify a new threat or possible
improvement to the spam filtering criteria. A component implementing the
criterion is created or modified. The component is tested for quality and
compatibility. The component is configured for and deployed using the system’s
automated update capability.

\textbf{Response Measure} ---
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cost: modifications to the filtering algorithms are easy to make.  In
  particular, less than 10% of the development time or cost of
  modification configuring the new capability to run with the existing
  software (conversely, the bulk of time is spent on developing and testing
  the algorithm itself).
\item Deployability: the new capability can be automatically deployed using a
  common update mechanism. Deployment does not adversely impact the customer’s
  email capabilities for a significant length of time (say, 3 minutes).
\end{enumerate}
 
Assumptions: We may wish to further refine this scenario into several more
detailed ones if we identify different classes of updates with different
characteristics. Here we assume that an update can use 1) existing inputs and
outputs, 2) the existing deployment mechanism, and 3) the existing spam
filtering infrastructure (e.g., the other parts of the system that retrieve or
modify email). Thus, we expect that only one module will be added or changed
and that none of the other interfaces will need to change. We may identify
other types of updates for which one or more of these assumptions are invalid.

\subsection{Interoperability}
A key business goal is that the Spam Filter work with the most common email
clients.
 
\textbf{Source} --- Anticipated customer base. 

\textbf{Stimulus} --- Identification of a mail client that the spam filter must work with. 

\textbf{Artifact} --- Spam filter installation and configuration
components. Mail client interface components (retrieve,

\textbf{Environment} --- Spam Filter install-time. Install or run-time
configuration for mail client interoperation. Run time interoperation with
mail client.

\textbf{Response} --- Provide interfaces and configuration utilities necessary
to 1) install the spam filter as a client plug-in, 2) allow any necessary
configuration of options to work with the mail client and 4) interoperate with
the mail client to fully perform the spam filtering functions at run time.

\textbf{Response Measure} --- The Spam Filter system installs and operates
seamlessly with each target mail client. These clients must include Outlook,
Outlook Express, Eudora, and Pegasus (or some other standard set)
 
This general scenario can be refined into a set of more concrete, detailed
scenarios – one for each mail client used by a significant portion of the
target market. It could also be decomposed into different scenarios covering
the different binding times for the interoperability. For example, we can have
one scenario for the install with Outlook, one for configuration, and one for
interoperation (and the same for each client where these might have different
results).
 
This scenario requires that the Spam Filter be tested with each client of
interest. This scenario does not assume that the Spam Filter must be
modifiable to accept new mail clients. This would be specified in a different
(Modifiability) scenario.

\subsection{Time to Market}
A key business goal is that the Spam Filter utility be deployed quickly to
establish market share and initiate a revenue stream. However, this business
goal and accompanying scenario must be addressed concurrently with the
following business goals and scenarios: 1) Rollout – ability to roll out new
versions of the system with additional features later 2) Extensibility – with
rollout, a capability necessary for the system’s upgrade path. In other words,
meeting time to market cannot sacrifice the capability to deploy future
versions of the system with enhanced capabilities.
 
\textbf{Source} --- Marketing: analysis of market window for initial release

\textbf{Stimulus} --- Deadline: need to deploy initial set of capabilities
within a market window.

\textbf{Artifact} --- Initial useful subset of the spam filter.  

\textbf{Environment} --- Development time. 

\textbf{Response} --- Define initial increment and set due date within market
window.  Develop to schedule and requirements.

\textbf{Response Measure} --- 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Spam filter meets functional and quality requirements for the initial
  release.
\item Delivery on or before the market due date.
\end{enumerate}
 
This scenario assumes that marketing identifies 1) the necessary requirements
(functional and quality) for an initial release and 2) that marketing defines
the market window by which the first increment must be delivered. This
scenario might be refined by identifying more than one subset and
corresponding market window.
 
It actually does not make a lot of sense to define this kind of quality
requirement as a “scenario” since one cannot execute it except in the general
course of developing the product. It would be more natural to simply describe
this in terms of the requirements for the initial increment and its due date.
